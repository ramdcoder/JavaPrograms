Java program to find largest of three numbers

[Java program to find largest of three numbers](https://www.flowerbrackets.com/java-largest-of-three-numbers/)

Hereâ€™s the program to find largest of three numbers using if-elseâ€¦if.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class LargestOfThreeNumbersInJava
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      int a, b, c;
      System.out.println("Please enter three numbers: ");
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      a = sc.nextInt();
      b = sc.nextInt();
      c = sc.nextInt();
      if(a >= b && a >= c)
         System.out.println(a + " is the largest number.");
      else if(b >= a && b >= c)
         System.out.println(b + " is the largest number.");
      else
         System.out.println(c + " is the largest number.");
      sc.close();
   }
}

In the below java program we are going to find greatest of three numbers in java without getting input from user or without using Scanner class.

public class LargestOfThreeNumbersInJava
{
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
      int number1 = 52, number2 = 76, number3 = 83;  
      if(number1 >= number2 && number1 >= number3)  
         System.out.println(number1 + " is the largest number.");  
      else if(number2 >= number1 && number2 >= number3)
         System.out.println(number2 + " is the largest number.");  
      else
         System.out.println(number3 + " is the largest number.");
   }
}
