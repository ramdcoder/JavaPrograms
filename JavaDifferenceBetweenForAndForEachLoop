[Difference between for and for each loop in java](https://www.flowerbrackets.com/difference-between-for-and-for-each-loop-in-java/)

Here’s the program on difference between for–each and for loop.

// One dimensional array using for loop
int[] num = {2,4,6};
for(int a = 0; a < num.length; a++)
{
   System.out.println(num[a]);
}

// One dimensional array using for-each loop
int[] num = {2,4,6};
for(int a :  num)
{
   System.out.println(a);
}
