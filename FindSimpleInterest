Java program to find simple interest

It is calculated by using formula,

Simple Interest = (P x R x T) / 100

P – is principal amount.

R – is rate per annum.

T – is time in years.

Let’s see java program to calculate simple interest or write a program to calculate simple interest in java.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class SimpleInterestJavaProgram
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      float principal, rate, time;
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.print("Enter principal amount : ");
      principal = sc.nextFloat();
      System.out.print("Please enter rate annually : ");
      rate = sc.nextFloat();
      System.out.print("Please enter time(in years) : ");
      time = sc.nextFloat();
      float simpleInterest;
      simpleInterest = (principal * time * rate) / 100;
      System.out.println("The Simple Interest is : " + simpleInterest);
      sc.close();
   }
}


Output:

Enter principal amount : 10000
Please enter rate annually : 7
Please enter time (in years) : 3
The simple interest is : 2100.0
