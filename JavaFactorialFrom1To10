Hereâ€™s the factorial from 1 to 10. We are using for loop which loops from 1 to 10.

public class FactorialFrom1To10
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      int count;
      long factorial = 1;
      System.out.printf("%4s%30s\n", "Number", "Factorials");
      for(count = 1; count <= 10; count++)
      {
         factorial *= count;
         System.out.printf("%4d%,30d\n", count, factorial);
      }
   }
}


Output:

1 1
2 2
3 6
4 24
5 120
6 720
