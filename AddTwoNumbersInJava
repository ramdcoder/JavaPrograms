In the below java program first we are taking input from user using nextInt() method of Scanner class. 
First user enters two numbers. Then these two numbers are stored in two integer variables ‘a’ and ‘b’.
Lastly two numbers are added using “+” operator. Let’s see sum of two numbers using Scanner or program to add two numbers taking input from user.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class AddTwoNumbers
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      int a, b, c;
      System.out.println("Please enter two integers to add: ");
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      a = sc.nextInt();
      b = sc.nextInt();
      c = a + b;
      System.out.println("Sum of two numbers = " + c);
      sc.close();
   }
}


Output:
Please enter two integers to add: 
95
56

Sum of two numbers = 151
